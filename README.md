# Banknote_Authentication
Banknotes is an important asset to a nation as they are used to carry out financial activities amidst other things, however, there are inflow of counterfeits into the financial market.
These counterfeits have strong similarities to the original so much so that it is almost impossible to manually differentiate them.
The introduction of digital currencies by financial institutions to reduce the usage of physical banknotes has been applauded even though it is yet to significantly influence the circulation of fake notes. 
There are still lots of notes in circulation, and this gives fraudsters the opportunity to introduce counterfeits into the system leading to exposure and loss of profits among traders and financial institutions. 
Considering the aforementioned, and the role banknotes play in the financial market of a nation, it is therefore important to preserve its genuineness, hence, the significance of banknote authentication.
